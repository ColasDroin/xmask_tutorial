How to access the list of available knobs from a multiline variable?
How come some bb elements are already in the twiss after just building the collider (but not setting the beam-beam elements yet)?
Why, at the end of step 2, is the closed orbit reference so similar to the beam orbit? And, conversely, where do the small discrepancies come from? Why is it the reference orbit that is oscillating around the actual beam orbit, and not the opposite?
Is it the file core_co_lhcb1 that (undirectly ?) contains the orbit bumps observed in x and y at the end of step 2?
Why is dispersion worse at the end of step 2?
Is there a possibility to select a given bunch to track in the config file? Along with a given filling scheme?
